# Pokedex Project

Welcome to my Pokedex project! This web application is designed to be a fun and interactive way to explore and discover Pokémon. It's built with modern web technologies and pulls data dynamically to present detailed information on various Pokémon species.

## Live Site

Visit the Pokedex live at [https://yzzpuri13.github.io/Pokedex/](https://yzzpuri13.github.io/Pokedex/) to explore the world of Pokémon.

## Features

- **Interactive List of Pokémon**: Browse through a comprehensive list of Pokémon, each with a clickable card that reveals more details.
- **Detailed Pokémon Profiles**: View in-depth details about each Pokémon, including stats, abilities, and evolutions, by clicking on their card in the list.
- **Dynamic Search**: Quickly find Pokémon using the dynamic search feature, which filters the list as you type.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to work seamlessly across devices, ensuring a great user experience whether you're on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

## Technical Highlights

- **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: The core functionality of the Pokedex relies on fetching data from the PokéAPI. To manage this efficiently and enhance the user experience, the project utilizes `async/await` syntax within JavaScript. This approach allows for asynchronous operations to be handled in a more readable and synchronous-like manner, significantly simplifying the codebase and improving error handling.

    For example, retrieving the list of Pokémon and their details is done through async functions, ensuring that the application remains responsive and users receive timely feedback while data is being loaded.


## General Workflow
- Initialization: When the user first loads index.html, pokemon.js might run to fetch and display an initial list of Pokémon.
- User Interaction: As users interact with the page (e.g., searching for Pokémon, clicking on an entry for details), event listeners in your JavaScript files (search.js, pokemon-detail.js) respond to these actions.
- Data Fetching and Display: Based on user actions, your JavaScript might make additional API requests to fetch more data (e.g., details for a specific Pokémon) and then update the page content dynamically to reflect this new information.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML & CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the web pages, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Powers the dynamic aspects of the application, such as loading Pokémon data and handling user interactions.
  - `pokemon.js`: Manages fetching and displaying the list of Pokémon.
  - `pokemon-detail.js`: Handles fetching and presenting detailed data for individual Pokémon.
  - `search.js`: Implements the live search functionality to filter Pokémon by name.
- [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for fetching detailed Pokémon information.  

## Running Locally

To run the Pokedex on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local device:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Yzzpuri13/Pokedex.git
